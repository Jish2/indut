## About The Project

[![screenshot (in progress)][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

</div>

Indut is a project I thought of in September of 2021. I began pursuing this on February 8th, 2022.

The original idea consisted of a website where you would be able to upload your clothes to a digital closet, in which a complete set of outfit would be randomly generated for you, all unique outfits.

However, the simple idea quickly stemmed into a more complex project as I received feedback from my peers.

## Contributing</div>

Because our app relies so heavily on the size of the database, user contribution is the best way to expand it.

We hope to implement a way to allow users to publish new clothing items to the public database to further expand it. Being the lone developer, it is extremely time consuming to add entries to the database. I hope to add this feature along with a queue to quality check the item. In the future I may create a web-scraper that can automate this problem.

Any further suggestions or feedback would also be greatly appreciated. They can be posted in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Jish2/indut/issues) or suggestions can be emailed to me at [jgoon@defended.store](mailto:jgoon@defended.store).
